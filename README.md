# subjectiveLogic


A small framework with code to support and Subjective Logic operations and visualise results.

In the Java framework, Subjective Opinions are the objects. There is the abstract framework.SubjectiveOpinion class, and then the two concrete subclasses: BinomialOpinion and MultinomialOpinion.

You can carry out SL operations by instantiating opinions (either Binomial or Multinomial). The operators to combine them (at least a couple) are implemented in the respected concrete classes. 

Refer to the test cases for examples.

Please feel free to add operations as you see fit to the concrete classes. 

Pull requests very welcome.

The R code is really just some utility code to, for example, visualise barycentric triangles and corresponding Beta-distributions.
